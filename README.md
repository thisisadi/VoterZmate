# VoterZmate

### **OUR NEED:**

The basic goal of democracy is for people to be able to "vote" for candidates who will establish an efficient administration that will meet their needs and requests and enhance their level of living. 

Some of the problems that are faced by people in physical voting are:

1. People either do not get a chance to cast their vote as their registered polling location differs from their current living location or they do not go to the polling center at all.
1. Individual might change the program installed in the EVM and can tamper with the electoral results.
1. Rigging is the most common problem faced by the election commission of India in which an individual can cast more than one vote in a different constituency.

### **OUR GOAL:**

In order to solve the problems encountered during traditional voting, as discussed by earlier we have designed and developed an android application which can be used to conduct the voting process in a disciplined and systematic manner. Our app shall allow people to vote for their preferred candidate directly through their smartphone devices. Our app also keeps in mind that elections should at no point of time be rigged so we have added biometric fingerprint scanning into it. The fingerprint scanning system works by encrypting a new user’s fingerprint using visual cryptography algorithms and later on verifying it upon each login. After casting their vote in the ongoing elections screen, the user can navigate to the election results page at the end of the elections where our app’s backend shall count the votes casted for each candidate and display it for the participating users.
